# Bucketlist Tracker

Buckletlist Tracker is a Django-powered bucketlist application that helps keep track of those things you want to do in life `before you kick the bucket` (_in Jack Nicholas' voice_). 

It comes with the following features:
  - Full tests
  - Responsive User Interface
  - Exposed API endpoints
  - Excellent documentation

> The overriding design goal for Buckletlist Tracker is
> to make it as easy to use as possible.
> The idea is that exposing an API for use can help developers
> build atop this service.

### Version
0.0.1

### Tech

Bucketlist Tracker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Django] - Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code
* [Swagger] - The World's Most Popular Framework for APIs
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Bower] - A package manager for the web
* [Django Rest Framework] - Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs
* [HTML5 Boilerplate] - HTML5 Boilerplate helps you build fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites
* [Font Awesome] - Font Awesome gives you scalable vsector icons that can instantly be customized
* [jQuery] - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library

And of course, Bucketlist Tracker itself is open source with a [public repository][git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.
